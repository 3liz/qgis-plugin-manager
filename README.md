A cli tool for handling installed QGIS plugins. 

Mainly designed for managing QGIS Server plugins, it also works for QGIS  desktop
plugins.

Not tested on Windows.

## Installation

Python 3.9 **minimum**, you can make a Python venv if needed.
```bash
python3 --version
```

```bash
pip3 install qgis-plugin-manager
python3 -m pip install qgis-plugin-manager
```

## Environment variables

QGIS-Plugin-Manager will take care of following variables :

* `QGIS_PLUGIN_MANAGER_SOURCES_FILE` for storing a path to the `sources.list` otherwise, the current folder will be used.
* `QGIS_PLUGIN_MANAGER_CACHE_DIR` for storing all XML files downloaded otherwise, the current folder will be used `.cache_qgis_plugin_manager`
* `QGIS_PLUGIN_MANAGER_SKIP_SOURCES_FILE`, boolean when we do not need a `sources.list` file, for instance to list plugins only
* `QGIS_PLUGIN_MANAGER_RESTART_FILE`, path where the file must be created if QGIS server needs to be restarted.
* `QGIS_PLUGIN_MANAGER_INCLUDE_PRERELEASE`, boolean for including prerelease, development 
or experimental versions of plugins.
  Read [the documentation](README.md#notify-upstream-if-a-restart-is-needed).
* `QGIS_PLUGINPATH` for storing plugins, from [QGIS Server documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/server_manual/config.html#environment-variables)
* `PYTHONPATH` for importing QGIS libraries

## Utilisation

**Either** you need to go in the directory where you are storing plugins, **or** you can use the environment variable `QGIS_PLUGINPATH`.
You can read the [documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/server_manual/config.html#environment-variables)
on QGIS Server about this variable.

```bash
cd /path/where/you/have/plugins
# usually on a server
cd /usr/lib/qgis/plugins
# on unix desktop with the default QGIS profile
cd /home/${USER}/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins
# or
export QGIS_PLUGINPATH=/path/where/you/have/plugins
```

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager --help
usage: qgis-plugin-manager [-h] [-v] {version,init,list,remote,remove,update,upgrade,cache,search,install} ...

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Activate verbose (debug) mode (default: False)

commands:
  qgis-plugin-manager command

  {version,init,list,remote,remove,update,upgrade,cache,search,install}
    version             Show version informations and exit
    init                Create the `sources.list` with plugins.qgis.org as remote

    search              Search for plugins
    check               Check compatibility of installed plugins with QGIS version
```

### Init

To create the first `sources.list` in the directory with at least the default repository https://plugins.qgis.org :
```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager init
$ cat sources.list 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.34
```

You can have one or many servers, one on each line.

### List

List all plugins installed :

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager list

Name               Version Folder
------------------ ------- -------------
Lizmap server      2.13.1  lizmap_server
atlasprint         3.4.3                
cadastre           2.1.1                
wfsOutputExtension 1.8.3 
```

List outdated plugins including prerelease/experimental versions


```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager list --outdated --pre

Name          Version Latest       Folder
------------- ------- ------------ -------------
Lizmap server 2.13.1  2.13.2-alpha lizmap_server
cadastre      2.1.1   2.1.2-alpha            
```


#### Install needed plugins only, mainly on QGIS server

**Important note**, install **only** plugins you need **you**. On QGIS **desktop**, plugins can slow down your computer.
On QGIS **server**, plugins are like **hooks** into QGIS server, they can alter input or output of QGIS server.
They can produce **unexpected** result if you don't know how the plugin works. Please refer to their respective documentation
or the application that needs QGIS server plugins (for instance,
[plugins for Lizmap Web Client](https://docs.lizmap.com/current/en/install/pre_requirements.html#qgis-server-plugins))

### Remote

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager remote
List of remotes :

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.34

$ cat sources.list 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=[VERSION]
```

`[VERSION]` is a token in the `sources.list` file that is  to be replaced by the current QGIS version available on your system (ex: 3.40)

If QGIS is upgraded, the XML file will be updated as well.

You don't have to set the TOKEN for all URL : 

`https://docs.3liz.org/plugins.xml` is valid.

#### Basic authentication

It's possible to add a login and password in the remote URL, with `username` and `password` in the query string :

```bash
https://docs.3liz.org/private/repo.xml?username=login&password=pass
```

Every URL is parsed, and if some credentials are found, the URL is cleaned and the request is done using the
basic authentication.

### Update

To fetch the XML files from each repository :

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager update
Downloading https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.34...
	Ok
$ ls .cache_qgis_plugin_manager/
https-plugins-qgis-org-plugins-plugins-xml-qgis-3-34.xml
```

### Versions

Check available versions of a plugin including prerelease/experimental versions:

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager versions cadastre --pre

cadastre

Version QGIS min Status Source
------- -------- ------ ------------------------------------------------------
2.2.0   3.28.0   ST     https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.40
1.6.2   3.0.0    SXT    https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.40

Status: S = Server, X = Experimental, D = Deprecated, T = Trusted
```

### Search

Look for plugins according to tags and title :

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager search dataviz
Data Plotly
QSoccer
```

### Install

Plugins are case-sensitive and might have spaces in its name :
```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager install dataplotly
Plugin dataplotly latest not found.
Do you mean maybe 'Data Plotly' ?
$ qgis-plugin-manager install 'Data Plotly'
```

Install the latest version :
```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager install QuickOSM
Installation QuickOSM latest
	Ok QuickOSM.1.16.0.zip
```

or a specific version :

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager install QuickOSM==1.14.0
Installation QuickOSM 1.14.0
	Ok QuickOSM.1.14.0.zip
```

You can use `--force` or `-f` to force the installation even if the plugin with the same version is already installed.

#### Enable a plugin

On QGIS **server**, there isn't any setting to enable/disable a plugin.

However, on **desktop**, you still need to enable a plugin, the equivalent of the checkbox in the QGIS graphical plugin
manager.

For instance, with the default profile, usually located in :

```bash
/home/${USER}/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/QGIS/
```

you need to edit the `QGIS.ini` file with :

```ini
[PythonPlugins]
nameOfThePlugin=true
```

### Upgrade

Upgrade all plugins installed :

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager upgrade
```

You can use `--force` or `-f` to force the upgrade for all plugins despite their version.

*Note*, like APT, `update` is needed before to refresh the cache.

#### Ignore plugins from the upgrade

Some plugins might be installed by hand, without being installed with a remote. This command will try to upgrade
**all valid** plugins found in the directory. However, the command will fail because the plugin has been installed 
without a remote.

It's possible to ignore such plugin by adding a file `ignorePlugins.list`, in your plugins' folder,
with a list of **plugin name** on each line. The `upgrade` will not try to upgrade them.

### Remove

It's possible to use `rm -rf folder_dir` but you can also remove by the plugin name.
It will take care of the `QGIS_PLUGINPATH` environment variable.

```bash
$ qgis-plugin-manager remove Quickosm
Plugin name 'Quickosm' not found
Do you mean maybe 'QuickOSM' ?
$ qgis-plugin-manager remove QuickOSM
Plugin QuickOSM removed
Tip : Do not forget to restart QGIS Server to reload plugins ðŸ˜Ž
```

### Notify upstream if a restart is needed

When a plugin is installed or removed and if the environment variable `QGIS_PLUGIN_MANAGER_RESTART_FILE` is set,
an empty file will be created or touched. It can notify you if QGIS Server needs to be restarted for instance.

This is useful for a deployment with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for instance.

Note that you must manually remove this file.

## Run tests

NOTE: Use a virtual env (python3 -m venv)

```bash
pip install -e .
cd tests
pytest -v
```
